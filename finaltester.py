This condition was likely caused by a lack of symptoms or underlying cardiac conditions.\n\nTreatment for this condition included administration of fluids and levothyroxine, which helped improve her heart rate. The patient also remained asymptomatic during this time. Additionally, the patients thyroid function may have been impacted due to the administration of levothyroxine.\n\nSymptoms that indicate this bradycardia include the patients heart rate dipping to the 50s, although she remained asymptomatic.
